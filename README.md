Penrose
=======

A Penrose Tiling Generator I made during two days of easter 2012 after a sudden dash of inspiration.

To develop locally, run `make penrose` and you should be able to access the application on `localhost:8088`.

The final result can be seen on http://penrose.dynkarken.com/, and the code is free to use under a MIT license (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
