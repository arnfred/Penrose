Penrose
=======

A Penrose Tiling Generator I made during two days of easter 2012 after a sudden dash of inspiration.

To run set up a python virtualenv, then install requirements and run:
```sh

sudo pip install virtalenv # Install virtualenv
cd YOUR_WORKSPACE # navigate to your workspace
git clone https://github.com/arnfred/Penrose.git # Clone repo
cd Penrose # Navigate to the freshly cloned repository
virtualenv env # Set up new virtualenv
source env/bin/activate # Activate environement
pip install -r requirements.txt # install all requirements
python server.py # Run program
```

Now you should be able to navigate to `0.0.0.0:8080` to see the local version

The final result can be seen on http://penrose.dynkarken.com/, and the code is free to use under a MIT license (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
